Ever since I came across <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Thomas Frank’s impossible list</a> I knew I had to make one for myself. He got the idea from a dude named <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/" target="_blank">Joel Runyon</a> who I believe is the founder of impossible lists. <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/the-impossible-list-is-not-a-bucket-list/" target="_blank">He explains</a> that the main difference between an impossible list and a bucket list is that while the bucket list is static and typically gets smaller as you cross items off, the impossible list evolves as you complete goal tasks. Let’s say for example you do 30 sit-ups straight, next time aim for 40 and add it to the impossible list.

I’ll be 100% honest here, I took a lot of Thomas Frank’s goal categories because they were great categories quite frankly (no pun intended). Almost every productive person has goals that they want to achieve, but putting them somewhere public will not only hold you accountable, but also keep you reminded of what you’re aiming for.

Here goes.

Similar to who I got the idea from, I would encourage you to create your own impossible list. It’s kind of difficult to come up with goals off of the top of your head, at least it was for me, so I would recommend checking out Thomas’ or taking goals from this one. I think it’s ideal to have it somewhere digital but there’s nothing wrong with paper and pencil too. Just make sure you account for adding sub-goals and even sub-categories.
